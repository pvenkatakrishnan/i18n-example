# i18n-example

An example kraken 1.0 app with i18n.
The supported locales in the sample are

* en-US
* es-ES
* de-DE

To see it working with different locales:

```
Start the app:
$ node .

In your browser:

localhost:8000/setLocale/en-US
localhost:8000/setLocale/es-ES
localhost:8000/setLocale/de-DE

This will automatically set the locale and redirect to the index page in the right locale
```
